# Identify your customers

## Rationale
This is a result of spending a weekend at [Innovate Houston](http://cvcx.org/accelerate-houston-2/), working to develop a viable business model for Django (and, by extension, other FLOSS projects). One thing we did was use the [Impact Canvas](http://www.socialblueprint.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ISA_The-Social-Blueprint_-Impact-Canvas_v3.21.pdf), a version of the [Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc). For those unfamiliar, the BMC is a 1 page way to quickly see the key points of your business model, to see if they make sense.


1.  During conversations with **non-developers**, they were shocked to hear that organizations they knew (like Instagram & Pinterest) were using FLOSS but NOT contributing to or supporting those projects. While I spoke to people about Django *specificially*, I'm going to assume this is true for MOST FLOSS projects. Most non-developers aren't aware of this issue.
2.  As we dug into the BMC move, a few key questions popped out. These seem like questions LOTS of FLOSS projects need to have answers to.
    1. Who ARE your customers?
    2. What is the your project's relationship WITH those customers? Does it HAVE one?
    3. How does your project REACH or INTERACT with those customers?

This document focuses mostly on point 2. If there's GOING to be a business model, you need CLEAR answers to ALL of three of the sub-points to point 2. If you don't know WHO you're doing business with, you're not really *in* business.

Some quick thinking makes it clear that there are at LEAST two different groups of (commercial) customers, ie "people using it for business", for most projects:

-  Large, commercial customers: (any well-know commercial enterprise using your project)
-  Smaller (1-10 person? Pick a value of *small*) commercial users: these may be consultants or smaller commercial enterprises using your project.

Focusing on the larger, commercial customers, it would be useful to *start* a list of "large" users of your project (with 'large' NOT being well defined at the moment). The goal is to start identifying customers and figuring out what kind of relationship your project does or can have with them. Know WHO they are will also shed light on *how* to create something they will value. Which leads to creating a value exchange based ON that relationship. There may be things I'm NOT aware of, but as far as I know now, the relationship of a LOT of FLOSS projects to their customers is:
>  Customers: We download `insert your FLOSS project here` and use it.
>  FLOSS Project Community: We update, maintain and upload `insert your FLOSS project here`, so people can download and use it.

There's no business model there. Identifying the customers more clearly makes it possible to identify spaces for value creation. You can't give a stranger what they want. You don't KNOW what they want. Because they're a stranger.



## Going forward
This isn't intended to be a complete or exhaustive list, it's TWO things:

-  A starting point, for listing significant customers of your FLOSS project.
-  A starting point, as far as **thinking about** customers of your FLOSS project. Who are they? What do they want/need? How can we provide it AND capture some of the value?
